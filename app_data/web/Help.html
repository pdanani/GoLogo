        <h2>I need help using goLogoLo! What can I do?</h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Open  a new project!</h3>
        
        <p>First create a new project from the welcome dialog or from the top toolbar.<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Add Items to Your New Canvas</h3>
        
        <p>On the right pane (the edit components pane), add items to your canvas by selecting from a number of options such as: Add text, Add Image, etc.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Edit Canvas Items</h3>
        
        <p>Select your items in the canvas and use the Edit Components Pane to edit your layers.<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Remove Canvas Items</h3>
        
        <p>Should you wish to remove a layer, select it from the canvas and
            then click on the "Delete Selected Component" button.<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 5: Move Items and Resize them</h3>
        
        <p>By clicking and dragging on a component you can move selected
            items in the canvas up, down and around the canvas, which could represent the
            "order" of the canvas components.<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 6: Save the To Do List</h3>
        
        <p> Once you have completed your work or would like to take a break from creating your masterpiece,
            you can press the save button and give your file a name, then save your file and open it again later. <br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 7: Export your work to an Image File!</h3>
        
        <p>Press the Export button when you wish to export your goLogoLo canvas into 
            an image file that you can use for your company, website or other business adventures!</p>
